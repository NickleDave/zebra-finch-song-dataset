# zebra-finch-song-dataset

Just a script to download this dataset from Tim Gardner's old site:

Might be useful if you wanted to implement SAP in Python or something like that :)

We should probably ask the original authors to publish at some point.
If you are interested in doing so, I'd like to be involved (to help organize, not as an "author"): nicholdav at gmail com
